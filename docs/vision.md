🚀 Vision
This project is more than just a weekend build — it's the foundation for a scalable, impactful SaaS product in the hiring-tech space. With the right momentum, it can evolve into a smart recruiting and resume-building platform that offers real utility to both job seekers and companies.

💡 Future Directions
1. Turnkey Paid SaaS for Job Seekers
Offer a freemium model for basic resume tools.

Monetize through a Pro plan with features like:

AI-assisted resume customization per job

Portfolio site generation

Analytics on resume engagement (views, clicks from recruiters)

Integrate Stripe for payments and track conversion events with real-time analytics.

2. Integration with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
Use APIs to let users directly submit resumes to common ATS platforms (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever, Workable).

Provide feedback on ATS compatibility, flagging formatting or keyword issues.

Offer a dashboard for job seekers to track their application status across platforms.

3. Smart Resume Builder with Stripe Job Scraping
Scrape job listings from the Stripe careers site and other YC/startup boards.

Automatically extract required skills and keywords to tailor resumes.

One-click “apply” with AI-optimized resumes for each job.

Vision: “What if your resume wrote itself for every job you wanted?”

🎯 Who This Is For
Builders aiming to get into Stripe, Y Combinator, or venture-backed startups.

Engineers frustrated by outdated recruiting tools.

Founders building “unbundled LinkedIn” products with a focus on speed, UX, and automation.

🧠 Long-Term Possibilities
Recommendation engine: Match resumes with roles using vector embeddings.

Network effects: Recruiters can search an anonymized database of high-quality resumes.

Browser extension: Auto-scan job listings on AngelList, LinkedIn, etc., and suggest optimizations.
